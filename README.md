# Linear-Regression without any library

Predicted values are compared with Scikit-learn library (Linear regression)

Check out the [Book example comparision file](book_example_comparision.ipynb) to see the comparision of population predicted using Linear Regression created from scratch and Scikit-Learn Linear Regression. This file solves the [Example](example.png) given in the book.


To validate and verify the correctness of the algorithm, it was also tested on dataset [Indian Population dataset](IndiaPopulation.csv).

Check out the [Population Prediction](population_prediction.ipynb) to see the comparision. This files predicts the population using Linear Regression without any library and then compares the output with the Scikit-learn Linear Regression predictions.
